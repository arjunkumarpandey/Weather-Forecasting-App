# Weather-App-Forecasting
Design a Weather Forecasting App using Java


Creating a weather forecasting application in Java involves several steps, including obtaining weather data from an API, processing the data, and displaying it in a user-friendly manner. Here's a basic outline of how you might approach building a simple weather forecasting app in Java:

Get API Key:

Choose a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherbit, etc.).
Sign up for an account and obtain an API key.
Create a Java Project:

Set up a new Java project in your favorite IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
Make HTTP Requests:

Use a library like java.net.HttpURLConnection or an external library like Apache HttpClient to make HTTP requests to the weather API using your API key.
Parse JSON Data:

Extract relevant weather information from the JSON response returned by the API. You can use libraries like Gson or Jackson for JSON parsing.
Design User Interface:

Create a simple user interface (UI) using Swing, JavaFX, or any other GUI library. This could include input fields for the location and a display area for the weather information.
Handle User Input:

Implement code to handle user input, such as the location for which they want to get the weather forecast.
Display Weather Information:

Update the UI to display the retrieved weather information. This could include details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
Error Handling:

Implement error handling to manage cases where the API request fails or the user provides incorrect input.
